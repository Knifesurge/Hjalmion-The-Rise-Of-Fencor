# Hjalmion-The-Rise-Of-Fencor
My repository for my self made text-based adventure game, Hjalmion: The Rise Of Fencor, made in Python 3.X

This game has been coded by me, Knifesurge. If you have any requests on new things to put in or possibly enhancing existing code, please let me know! I am always available on Discord at Knifesurge#1723

## How to run

While on the *old* branch, you can launch Game.py on the command line with the Python command. It takes no arguments.
