# Hjalmion-The-Rise-Of-Fencor
My repository for my self made text-based adventure game, Hjalmion: The Rise Of Fencor, made in Python 3.X

This game has been coded by me, Knifesurge. If you have any requests on new things to put in or possibly enhancing existing code, please let me know! I am always available at hjalmionlabs@outlook.ca

# Updates
## (2019-03-22)
I have decided to do something new with this project since it has been sitting idle for the last ~~ ~3 ~~ __5__ years.

I am going to be rewriting the vast majority of the codebase. This should help clean up the project and reduce the amount of lines the main file (Hjalmion.py) has (currently almost 3k lines!).

### Plans
I plan on making the game itself more flexible and customizable so that adding new/custom items/enemies/rooms is possible without rewriting large chunks of code. Also, I plan on moving away from using the *pickle* module, and moving towards saving using the JSON format. This seems (to me) the more reasonable choice, and follows with my plan on making the game more flexible (i.e, the save file is entirely editable).

The game will load Items, Enemies, and Rooms from respective JSON files. Again, this follows with the more flexible pursuit.
